# Task

You are the executive committee in an anarcho-syndicalist commune and as a way of keeping the 
masses under control you want to examine whether chemtrails would actually work. This project is 
about writing a simple tool that will calculate for you the approximate area covered by a 
chemtrail-distribution system based on flight paths supplied by the user and the additional energy required 
to carry that payload alongside regular passengers. Results should be in the form of square meters covered and
energy cost in Joules, as well as an optional visual representation on a map and the density of the gas at ground level. 
The threshold gas level for visualization on the ground, as well as the plane height, should be specifiable by the user.
